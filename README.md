# About

&emsp; **JRKGBites** is an Android application designed to eliminate the indecision of choosing where to eat. It offers an interactive and personalized experience to help users find the perfect dining spot based on their cravings, mood, and preferences.

This application aims to solve the common problem of "decision fatigue" when it comes to dining. By providing a fun, gesture-based interface and smart recommendations, JRKG Bites streamlines the process of discovering and selecting a restaurant.

The project is built using Kotlin and follows a modern MVVM-like architecture (View, ViewModel, Domain, Data) to ensure a clean, scalable, and maintainable codebase.

</br>

## Features
JRKGBites provides the following features:

- **🛡️ Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login using email/password with Google one-tap sign-in options.  

- **❤️ Personalised Interactions:** Save your favourite restaurants for easy access, mark a restaurant as "Never Again" to remove it from your recommendations, and rate restaurants based on your experience.

- **🫳 Gesture-Based Interface:** An intuitive Tinder-style swipe system to manage your restaurant choices:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  ⬆️ Swipe Up: Save a restaurant to your Favorites.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  ⬇️ Swipe Down: Add a restaurant to your "Never Again" list.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  ⬅️ Swipe Left: Discard for now.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  ➡️ Swipe Right: View restaurant details.  

- **🔀 Shake to Decide:** A "roulette" feature that randomly picks a restaurant for you when you shake your device in the "Favorites" screen. Each user gets 3 spins per day (1 free + 2 via ads). Watch a short ad to earn more spins when you run out. (Test only: "Reset Spins (DEV)" button made available now for testing).

- **📍 Location-Aware:** Filters restaurants based on your proximity, with options to see details and get directions via Google Maps.  

- **🔍 Comprehensive Search:** Easily search the entire restaurant database, including those you've previously dismissed.

- **🏪 Restaurant Management:** Add missing restaurants to the app, edit details of added restaurants, and have the option to permanently delete them.

- **👤 User Profile:** View your stats, manage preferences, and access your restaurant ratings.

- **☁️ Firebase Integration:** Your data is securely stored in the cloud. Therefore, your progress will be saved across devices and sessions.

- **📂 Offline Capability:** Works with a local `JRKGBites.json` file, ensuring the app is functional even without an internet connection.

## Project Structure

This project uses a clear **Model–View–ViewModel (MVVM)** structure to separate presentation from business and data concerns, making the codebase easier to navigate, test, and maintain.

```
                                 View
                                   |
                                   v
                                ViewModel
                                /       \
                               v         v
                          Domain -----> Repository
                                        /       \
                                       v         v
                                 Local DB      Remote DB
                                  (Room)      (Firestore)
                                    |
                                    v
                                 SQLite
```

</br>

The project is organized into four main layers, promoting a separation of concerns:
-   `view`: The UI layer containing the fragment classes.
-   `viewmodel`: The `MainViewModel.kt` acts as the brain of the UI, managing state and handling user interactions.
-   `domain`: Contains the core business and use-case logic in manager classes like `SwipeManager`, `RestaurantPicker`, and `AuthManager`.
-   `data`: Manages all data sources, including the `RestaurantRepository` (for `JRKGBites.json`) and `UserPreferencesManager`.
